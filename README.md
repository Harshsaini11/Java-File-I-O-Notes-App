# Java-File-I-O-Notes-App
How It Works. 1. Add Note → User types a note → saved in notes.txt using FileWriter. 2. View Notes → Program reads file line by line with BufferedReader and displays notes with numbers. 3. Delete Note → User selects a note number → program removes it from the list and rewrites the file. 4. Exit → Closes the app.
